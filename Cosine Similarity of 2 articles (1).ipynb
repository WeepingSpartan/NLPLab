    "It's a near precise rendering of the travelogue as a self help book. A young Kaag was an avowed Nietzsche acolyte but given the ravages of responsibilities and adulthood, the writer put his affinity to test by undertaking physically enduring hikes through the Alps, revisiting haunts that the philosopher escaped to, in search of solitude and salve. The journey's demands, coupled with his own inner turmoil, are catnip for anybody feeling at cross purposes with their own life.\n",
    "In the book, Kaag qyites Neitzsche writing to his mother after he had spent time in Splugen, \"I was overcome by the desire to remain here... this high alpine valley... There are pure, strong gusts of air, hills and boulders of all shapes... But what pleases me the most are the splendid highroads over which I walk for hours.\" Travel as the answer to searching questions is harddly a radical idea but what's endearing about the book is that it subtly confirms a basic tenet of why we go on these journeys in the first place. Sometimes, being on the move matters more than anything else.''','''\n",
